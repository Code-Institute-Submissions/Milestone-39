Project title: The Forge 

Overview: This is a simple game using javascript. A player will choose a character from the home page which will then send them to a comfirmation screen. After this a random enemy is selected for them too fight and the player simply keeps clicking attack untill; they or the computer wins. Although this project is functional and close to how I want it look visually it's not 100% finished although as I said the functionality is all there. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

UX: This website would maily be aimed at men/boys ranging in the ages of 10-25. Although woman and men outside of the age range provided might find some entertainment from the simplicity and easy reuse value I do believe the main demographic will be the one stated. I reasearched a couple of similar games that work on the same basic concept and i believe this to be sufficient for my assumptions. 

User Comments: I have not had any user feed for this project as of yet.

Features:- 

-The website seamlessly transfers from pc to mobile so any user wanting to play at home or on the go can have easy access

-The game is simple and easy to use with colourful buttons and interesting fonts to attract users and keep them interested. 

-The game has lovely pictures and a simple and easy to use navigation bar although it only take you too the home page it's the only place users will really want to go from anywhere in the website.

Technologies Used:

Bootstrap:- -- I have used bootstrap for the basic structure of the website. Taking advantage of it's powerful preset CSS functionality. Although I have used bootstrap to help with the layout I have manipulated and personalised the preset CSS with my own custon coding.

Google Fonts:- -- I have used google fonts, importing the style directly into the css stylesheet. I have simply used this service as a means to get custom fonts.

Testing:

Test 1:- 

What?: I was constantly testing how the website looked across many devices. How?: I did this by making the website live and seeing how the game looked on; ipad, iphone 6s, sony experia, iphone x, PC and others. Why?: I did this so that users, no matter what device the use, can have a decent visual experience. When?: I was doing this constantly throughout the project. 

Test 2:- 

What?: Testing the attacks of the player and enemy. How?: By playing around with different input into the player and enemy object values I was able to figure out how I wanted everything too work and to be calculated. Why?: I did this because I could get player and enemy stats to come up on the screen but when I clicked attack I was get NaN results. I couldn't figure out why this was happening to I created a seperate object for both the player and the enemy wich seemed to solve the problem. Also I believe this will make it easier for future development, maybe having certain enemy/player specific abilities.

Deployment:

The overall deployment of the project was relativly simple as I used git hub pages, as I've been using git pod to develop my website this just felt to fit hand in hand.
